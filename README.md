# ML-Loan-Flagging-Project
This project entails building machine learning models to predict whether a loan application should be flagged or not.


# Description

This repository contains machine learning models designed to predict whether a loan application should be flagged based on a variety of features. The dataset encompasses thousands of loans, 
including details like loan specifics, age of the applicant, past billings, credit score, and more. The main objective is to leverage this data to build models that can accurately determine 
the risk associated with each loan application.
